# Checker Contract

## Development

Install dependencies with:

```
npm ci
```

## ABI

There is an `abi.json` file inside the scripts folder.

It can be generated by running:

```
$ npx hardhat run ./scripts/abi.ts
```

This is just a helper to have the Checker ABI more accessible, It can also be found when compiling the contract on:

```
./artifacts/contracts/Checker.sol/Checker.json (The Json has an abi property)
```

## Bytecode

There is a `bytecode.json` file inside the scripts folder, it has to be regenerated every time the contract changes in order to be able to run:

- `checkLAND.ts`

To regenerate it, simply run:

```
$ npx hardhat run ./scripts/bytecode.ts
```

## CheckLAND

The `checkLAND.ts` script runs a bunch of defined calls to the checkLAND function in the contract.

You can run it with:

```
$ npx hardhat run ./scripts/checkLAND.ts --network mainnet
```

Test cases can be added in the `checkLAND.tests.json` file.

The `checkLAND.aux.ts` file can be used to test the different values used by the checkLAND function for improved debugging.
